# AI-Ergasia1
This is a repository for my school assignments involving artificial intelligence. 
It is mainly in greek so i don't know how usefull it's going to be for everybody. 
I mainly use this repo so me and my team can work efficently on thin school project.

If you willing to look more on the code and figure what it is doing you can find a python implementation the A*, IDS and UCS algorithms
to find routes and solve a labyrinth puzzle.
